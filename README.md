# Feng Shui Your Java Projects with Monadic-Style Coding

This project demonstrates how to refactor Java code using monadic-style coding techniques to enhance code readability, maintainability, and cleanliness. The `ContributionService` has been refactored from an imperative style to a more functional, monadic approach.

## Project Overview

The `service` package contains two versions of the `ContributionService`:

- `ContributionServiceOld`: The original, imperative-style service.
- `ContributionServiceNew`: The refactored version that leverages functional programming principles and monadic-style coding.

## Project Structure

```bash
/src
  /main
    /java
      /nl/kooi/monadicstyle/service
        ├── ContributionServiceOld.java    # Imperative-style code
        └── ContributionServiceNew.java    # Refactored, monadic-style code
```
